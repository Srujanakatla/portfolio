            <h1>Stuffed Bitter Gourd curry | Stuffed Karela | Gutti Kakarakaya | How to make Stuffed Bitter Gourd curry / fry</h1>
            <p>Stuffed Bitter Gourd curry | Stuffed Karela | Gutti Kakarakaya | How to make Stuffed Bitter Gourd curry / fry - There are those who cringe at the "Bitter Gourd" and cry bitter..! But even those will be happy when they eat the Andhra style Bitter Gourd Fry. Here is a detailed recipe for the Bitter Gourd Fry with images and a video.</p>
            <img src="https://vismaifood.com/storage/app/uploads/public/6bb/913/42a/thumb__700_0_0_0_auto.jpg" alt="Recipe Image">
            <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></h3>
            <p>A brief description of the recipe. <span style="font-style: italic;">This recipe is very delicious.</span></p>

            <strong style="background-color: blue;">Tips</strong>
            <p>1.For this recipe, you should use the "tiny Bitter Gourds", those in the size of Ivy Gourd. I could not find them; I have used the smaller ones among the lot I had. If they are tiny, then they fry till the very core, and the fry tastes good.</p>

              <p> 2. Tender Bitter Gourds fry quickly and taste better.
                
                <p>  3. Peel the Bitter Gourds, rub them with the Salt Turmeric mixture and marinate for 30 minutes. Then the bitter juice will be extracted.</p>
                
                <p> 4. I have removed the seeds from the Bitter Gourd. But some people like the seeds so they can roast the seeds along with Red Chillies and make a Powder of it and use it. I have fried the Bitter Gourds in Oil and have stuffed them with this Powder. If you want, you can fry them half, take them out, seal them and fry again. And then, you can add the rest of the Powder and fry.</p>
                
                <p> 5. The way I made it, it doesn't need much oil.</p>
                
                <p> 6.If the Powder is left over, it can be eaten with Dosa, Idly or hot Rice. It starts fresh for a month.</p>

            <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Chicken Salna | Best for Dosa Chapathi and Rice</span></h3>
        <h1><strong>Tips</strong><br>
        </h1>
<b>Chicken Stock:</b>
<p>The more the Chicken Stock is cooked on a low flame, the better the Salna tastes.

Chicken Stock should have 80 % of Chicken Bones 80% only then the stock is tasty.

In case you have no time to make Chicken Stock, you can buy the readymade Chicken Stock Cubes and add them to the Water added to the fried Chicken.
</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        z
<b>Peanuts:</b>
<p>If the Peanuts are roasted slowly on a low flame, then the Nut gets fried till its core and adds taste to the Salna.

Salna does not taste good at all if the Peanuts are not roasted well or you add too many.</p>

<b>Poppy Seeds :</b>
<p>Poppy Seeds give the Salna great taste. But if you dont have them, you could use Cashew Nuts.</p>
